# Flag Hunters Challenge

## Challenge Description
```
Description
Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.
The program's source code can be downloaded here.
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 59014

Hints:
1. This program can easily get into undefined states. Don't be shy about Ctrl-C.
2. Unsanitized user input is always good, right?
3. Is there any syntax that is ripe for subversion?

## Solution

Given source file
```
import re
import time


# Read in flag from file
flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()

secret_intro = \
'''Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The ether’s ours to conquer, '''\

[REFRAIN]
We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.
CROWD (Singalong here!);
RETURN

[VERSE1]
Command line wizards, we’re starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

REFRAIN;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

REFRAIN;

Binary sorcerers, let’s tear it apart,
Disassemble the code to reveal the dark heart.
From opcode to logic, tracing each line,
Emulate and break it, this key will be mine.
Debugging the maze, and I see through the deceit,
Patch it up right, and watch the lock release.

REFRAIN;

Ciphertext tumbling, breaking the spin,
Feistel or AES, we’re destined to win.
Frequency, padding, primes on the run,
Vigenère, RSA, cracking them for fun.
Shift the letters, matrices fall,
Decrypt that flag and hear the ether call.

REFRAIN;

SQL injection, XSS flow,
Map the backend out, let the database show.
Inspecting each cookie, fiddler in the fight,
Capturing requests, push the payload just right.
HTML's secrets, backdoors unlocked,
In the world wide labyrinth, we’re never lost.

REFRAIN;

Stack's overflowing, breaking the chain,
ROP gadget wizardry, ride it to fame.
Heap spray in silence, memory's plight,
Race the condition, crash it just right.
Shellcode ready, smashing the frame,
Control the instruction, flags call my name.

REFRAIN;

reader(song_flag_hunters, '[VERSE1]')
```
The flag is hidden in the secret_intro part of the song, but this section is not printed by default because the script starts at [VERSE1].
Trigger the Refrain through the unsanitized input: 
```
help;RETURN 0
```
This will force the script to jump to line 0, which is the beginning of the song. Stop execution in the middle to retrieve flag.
